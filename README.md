  # Authentication information
  username  = "janedoe"
  api_key   = "33d0d62a6a163083ba7b3bab31bd6612"
  # IP address of the client making the request,
  # must be granted permission in Namecheap
  client_ip = "1.2.3.4"
}
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

List domains in your Namecheap account:

```sql
select
  domain,
  expires
from
  namecheap_domain
order by
  domain
```
